# Pro Predictions
We developed an innovative Apex Legends prediction game tailored for pro league tournaments, offering viewers an engaging and interactive experience. Hosted on the Avalanche Testnet blockchain, our platform enables users to predict the top six placements in a tournament, fostering community engagement and excitement surrounding competitive gaming events.

Key features of our application include:

1. **Prediction Submission**: Viewers can easily submit their predictions for the top six placements in the tournament through our user-friendly interface. Upon submission, users receive a unique NFT game pass, which serves as a digital token representing their entry into the prediction game.

2. **NFT Game Passes**: Each prediction is minted as an NFT game pass, with the user's predictions securely stored in the metadata of the token. This ensures transparency and immutability, allowing users to verify their predictions on the blockchain.

3. **Blockchain Integration**: Leveraging the Avalanche Testnet blockchain, our platform provides a secure and scalable environment for managing prediction submissions and recording results. Blockchain technology ensures transparency, fairness, and tamper-proof record-keeping throughout the prediction game.

4. **Scoring System and Leaderboard**: Users earn points based on the accuracy of their predictions. Those who correctly forecast the top placements accumulate points, contributing to their standing on the leaderboard. The leaderboard showcases top performers, fostering competition and incentivizing participation.

5. **Prize Pool**: Participants with the highest point totals have the opportunity to win from a prize pool. By rewarding accurate predictions, we encourage active engagement and enthusiasm among users, driving excitement surrounding tournament outcomes.

Overall, our Apex Legends prediction game offers an immersive and rewarding experience for viewers of pro league tournaments. By integrating blockchain technology, we ensure transparency, fairness, and security, enhancing user trust and participation in the gaming community.

# Particle Network
We utilized Particle Network along with account abstraction to streamline the user onboarding process for our application. Particle Network provided a decentralized identity solution, allowing users to create and manage their digital identities securely across various platforms. By integrating Particle Network, users could seamlessly authenticate and access our application using their decentralized identities, enhancing security and privacy.

Additionally, we implemented account abstraction techniques, which enabled users to interact with our application without directly handling blockchain addresses or managing complex cryptographic keys. Instead, users could seamlessly onboard to our app using familiar authentication methods, such as email or social media logins, while underlying blockchain transactions were abstracted away from the user interface. This approach simplified the onboarding process, reducing friction for users unfamiliar with blockchain technology and improving overall user experience.

# Covalent 
We streamlined the retrieval of all blockchain data by utilizing the Unified API, which provided a comprehensive interface to access information across multiple blockchain networks. This allowed us to efficiently gather relevant data for our application without the need to integrate separate APIs for each blockchain network. 

Furthermore, we leveraged the GoldRush Block Explorer Kit to design our user interface (UI). This kit provided a set of pre-designed components and tools tailored specifically for blockchain applications, enabling us to create an intuitive and visually appealing UI for our platform. By incorporating the GoldRush Block Explorer Kit, we were able to expedite the UI development process while ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience for our users interacting with blockchain data.

# Chainlink Functions
We employed Chainlink functions to seamlessly fetch tournament results from the Apex Legends Pro League. Chainlink functions, acting as decentralized oracles, facilitated the secure retrieval of real-time data from external sources. By integrating Chainlink into our smart contract infrastructure, we accessed reputable data sources, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of tournament results. This approach provided a transparent and immutable record of the event outcomes on the blockchain, enhancing trust and integrity within our gaming ecosystem.
